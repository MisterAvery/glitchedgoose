        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>This is where I post my projects. Some
          are small, some are big. Some are
          older and some are newer. Once again,
          keep in mind, my level of experiance at
          the time of making each one varried.
          This means some are poorly put together
          and some are much better organized.
          Anyway, I have samples of website elements.
          Some of these are samples of things I
          made with JavaScript, and some of them
          are games. To preserve the originallity of
          each one, I didn't add in a link back.
          So once you enter a link use the back button
          to get back. One more thing. The Javascript
          projects and most of the gmes will only work
          on computers. </p>
