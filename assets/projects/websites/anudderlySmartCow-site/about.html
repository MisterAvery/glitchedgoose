        <h1>What Is This Site??</h1>
        <p>This is my website. Here I will be posting all the things I create. Most of them are just little things I made pretty quickly. But some of these things took me a little while to make. Before you go into to the projects page, I want you to keep in mind that some of these things are, relativly, quite old. I didn't know what I do now and wasn't using the best practices. So, if you notice anything that is poorly put together or not well made, it's probably one of my earlier projects.</p>

        <h1>My story.</h1>
        <p>I first became hooked on programming in 6th grade. My science class was doing Layers of the Earth and my teacher decided to spice it up by having us make a 2D model with the Python programming language. Myself and one other kid became interested in it and proceaded to learn more about it. In late 6th grade Louis became interested in JavaScript and started persuing it. Naturally, I followed. Except I didn't share the same interest in it. I was interested in making things for the web.<br><br>After A quick Google Search, I discovered HTML and CSS. For those who don't know, they are the languages used for making websites. Even this website is written using those languages. When I discovered HTML and CSS, I began to take cources on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCadamy(Great site you should really check it out if your interested in learning to code)</a>. Once I had The basics down, I started experimenting with my newfound knowladge. Just seeing what I could make. After reaching the limit of what I knew, I took to youtube to learn more. Then, using what I just learned, I would create something new. Repeat that for two and a half years, add in rediscovery of JavaScript, and here I am today. With the skills and practice of a front-end web developer.</p>
